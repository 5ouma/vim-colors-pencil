> A color scheme for Vim inspired by iA Writer

iA Writer is an elegant word processor, only marred by its lack of Vim. It
does have a nice colorscheme, which this one is modeled after.

## Requirements

May require a recent version of Vim.

## Installation

Install using Pathogen, Vundle, Neobundle, or your favorite Vim package
manager.
