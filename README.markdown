> A light color scheme for Vim inspired by iA Writer

![markdown-example](screenshots/markdown-example.png)

## Features

iA Writer is an elegant word processor, marred only by its lack of Vim. It
does have a nice colorscheme, however.

* Accurate colors
* Subtle indicators of changes in the gutter for Signify, git-gutter, etc.
* Use for both code and prose, though it’s definitely geared towards the
  latter

## Requirements

May require a recent version of Vim.

## Installation

Install using Pathogen, Vundle, Neobundle, or your favorite Vim package
manager.

Or simply copy the colorscheme file to your `~/.vim/colors` directory.

## Usage

Just like any other colorscheme:

```vim
:colorscheme pencil
```

## Differences

Most notably, the ‘#’ heading text is shaded blue. This is to compensate
for the lack of a visual cue found in iA Writer where the heading
indicators are inside the left margin. Here we use color instead.

## Font choices

iA Writer uses a typeface called ‘Nitti Light’ by Blue Monday. ($)

## Future development

Eventually there’ll be a dark equivalent as well included in this
colorscheme.
