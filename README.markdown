> A light color scheme for Vim inspired by iA Writer

iA Writer is an elegant word processor, marred only by its lack of Vim. It
does have a nice colorscheme, which this one is inspired by.

* Subtle indicators of changes in the gutter for Signify, git-gutter, etc.
* Ideal for use in a distraction-free environment
* Use for both code or prose, though it’s definitely geared towards the
  latter

## Requirements

May require a recent version of Vim.

## Installation

Install using Pathogen, Vundle, Neobundle, or your favorite Vim package
manager.
